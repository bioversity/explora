Description: The "Explora" package is an R statistical application
    implementing a suite of algorithms, with associated user interfaces,
    which assist the selection of crop plant genetic resources for
    developing country deployment, based on trait, passport and
    related descriptor characteristics. Explora is being developed at
    Bioversity International within the CCAFS-funded Seeds-for-Needs Project.
